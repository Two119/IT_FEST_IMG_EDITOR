# IT_FEST_IMG_EDITOR
This is a simple AI based face recognition software, made in a few weeks for the Information Technology Festival held nearby my town every year. It was made in python.
By the way, I got the second prize for this at the competition :)
# Installation
Just open cmd and type ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
You need cmake and visual studio desktop c++ installed. The installation can take a while, and so can the startup of the program.
